## Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?

Q: Can you give a quick and easy explanation of your project's purpose? Consider using a narrative or example use case, such as via screenshots, video, or storyboarding.

We realized for alot of college students as well as young adults who are overwhelmed by daily schedules, cooking can be an albatrass where they experienced difficulty with deciding what to cook and how to cook with limited ingredients in their fridge. Based on our research, around 14% of college students conducted by the research of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has never cooked. As such, we intend to help these students with cooking.

To help these young adults eat healthy from home, we deviced a website where they can simply input ingreditents they have on hand, and we help them generate a list of potential meals from which they can choose and get further detailed information on. The whole website is built upon the background story of Disney character Ratetouille to spice up their lives with a bit more fun and joy.

## Implementation Information

Q: Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.
