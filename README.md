## Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?

Can you give a quick and easy explanation of your project's purpose? Consider using a narrative or example use case, such as via screenshots, video, or storyboarding.

We realized for alot of college students as well as young adults who are overwhelmed by daily schedules, cooking can be an albatrass where they experienced difficulty with deciding what to cook and how to cook with limited ingredients in their fridge.

To help these young adults eat healthy from home, we deviced a website where they can simply input ingreditents they have on hand, and we help them generate a list of potential meals from which they can choose and get further detailed information on. The whole website is built upon the background story of Disney character Ratetouille to spice up their lives with a bit more fun and joy.

## Implementation Information

Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.

## Results

Although each project will have unique details, showcasing your software's capabilities is essential! Screenshots and video can be especially useful. Include graphs and data, if appropriate.

## Project Evolution/Narrative

By exploring how your project developed over time, you can convey an illustrious story about creating software that improved throughout the process. You might include screenshots or other tools to demonstrate the project's evolution.

## Attribution
