# Project Proposal

## The Big Idea

We noticed that meal prep has always been an ordeal for most where people are confounded with limited raw materials they have on hand and don't know what to do with them. So, we intend to build a web app where users input some raw ingredients they have on hand and we return them a detailed recipe to prepare a meal with provided materials. We will mainly explore Flask, API, and potentially text mining where we extract useful information from recipe books. The minimum viable product would be to simply furnish users with a randomly generated recipe based on incorporated API, and we hope to incorporate more like providing users links to purchase ingredients they might need, incoorporating ChatGPT where user can ask questions about how to prep the rendered recipe.

## Learning Objective

Our shared goal is to learn more about how to incorporate API and Flask to implement descriptive analysis where an actione is recommended rather than a mere prediction or description. Since recommending recipe based on avaliable food has been a hot topic in generative AI world, we want to build a web app ourselves to better understand on the surface how AI potentially works and the machanism enabling real life recommendations from machines. From individual perspectives we both want to learn more about how to build a web app to actually interact with consumers like involving customer service chat services they will be useful when implemented in business worlds.

## Implementation Plan

We have done some initial research and found Spoonacular API useful for generating recipies based on provided ingredients. In detial we hope to incorporate multiple APIs so we provide users a more diverse range of recommendations they are able to choose from. Once the user log onto the web app, they are asked to enter ingredients they have on hand and whether they want to make a dessert, a snack, or a full meal with the it. Once they hit submit upon finishing their choices, they are redirected to the result page where they are provided with around 4 to 5 recommended recipes. Users can then click to choose the preferred recipe and more detialed implementation plan will be furnished including steps and how to prepare. If we are able to implement the above steps with ease, we want to include Doordash API or Instacard API to allow users make fast orders of the ingredients they potentially miss. In addition, we hope to include ChatGPT as a personal cuisine tutor to guide users step by step to get to the final dish. We will need to do more research on potential APIs to use and ways to incoporate cook books into the web. 

## Project Schedule

### 1st Week (April 8th -- April 14th)

Discussing detail of the project with potential APIs recommended and finishing up planning the workflow to prioritize tasks. Start coding functions needed and incorporating APIs while constantly experiment and find new APIs to use.

### 2nd week (April 15th -- April 21st)

Start woking on web app and initiallse all the features. Continue web app coding and adding additional features if viable. 


### 3rd week (April 22th -- April 27st)

Adding visual features and interactive interface with CSS. Finishing up all features with visually appealing interfaces.


## Collaboration Plan

We plan to work together on the project where we will meet regularly every week and each takes roles to code some part of the web app development and functions needed. We plan to make the collaboration more flexiable where each of us can constantly revisit former codes and come up with recommendations and suggestions for improvments during our regulat meeting. Because we plan to code individually and then get together to discuss what we have accomplished, we agreed to write detailed notes of what we have accomplished each day and document the meaning of each variable so we can both understand each other's logic and build off each other's work easily. This is out initial working plan: essentially dividing up work during regular weekly meetings and get back together to discuss the working progress.

## Risk and Limitations

One potential risk is to incorporate new APIs like Spoonacular that we have not used before and also ChatGPT which has always been a troule when we try to implement individually. Additionally, there might be scenarios where the provided ingredients might not make up to a full meal, so we need to device an mechanism to losen the constraints for raw materials to allow some flexibility. Additionally, we also want to incorporate dietary restrictions in our selection page which can add more difficulty when trying to render a viable recipe.

## Additional Course Content

We might want to revisit the ChatGPT API course material. We would like to learn more about flask to incorporate online chatting options where users can simply chat below the result page without being redirected to a new web page. In general, everything related to building a chatting feature in a web app would be useful.
